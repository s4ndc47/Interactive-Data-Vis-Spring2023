# Overall Reflection 

1. My primary objective for this project is to create something related to Hong Kong, as I am deeply attached to my home country and possess a strong desire to contribute to its development. Initially, I wasn't particularly interested in the topic suggested by Professor, which involved utilizing the 2021 U.S. Census Data for an interactive project. Instead, I aimed to present data specific to Hong Kong. However, during my research, I stumbled upon a political campaign from 2020 titled "Fill Yourself as Hong Kongers" initiated by We the Hong Kongers. This led me to investigate the presence of "Hong Kong" within the U.S. Census data. Remarkably, I discovered that the U.S. census data has been including Hong Kong as an option for birthplace since 2011, spanning a period of ten years. This realization immediately sparked my interest, and I became determined to base my project on this topic.

2. Initially, my project prospectus outlined the presentation of only two charts. However, as I delved deeper into the project, I found myself creating a total of ten charts. While the final outcomes significantly deviated from my initial prospectus, I am pleased with the progress I made.

3. Throughout this project, I consistently grappled with the question of how to effectively depict an overview of a community. To accomplish this, I placed emphasis on key factors such as total population, sex distribution, age distribution, educational attainment, income levels, and occupational composition. I found that presenting these aspects in a time series format, viewed from the perspective of a data narrative, proved to be a favorable approach. Also, through the utilization of a line chart to compare the income levels between males and females, an evident gender income gap within the community is revealed.

4. Furthermore, I sought to explore the impact of historical factors on the community. For instance, I aimed to investigate how the implementation of Obama's health insurance policy influenced the insurance rates among U.S. residents, particularly within the Hong Kong community. Additionally, I examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the employment status of Hong Kong individuals. Notably, there was a notable surge in remote work arrangements following 2019.

5. The major design decisions I made for my visuals include the font, color scheme, and the use of illustrations. For the font, I opted for the classic fonts Roboto for the body text and Merriweather for the headings primarily because of their accessibility and cost-effectiveness as free font options. For the color scheme, I aimed to create a modern, media-like aesthetic by choosing unusual colors. To enhance the visual impact, I incorporated illustrations into graphics. I also employed a black and white treatment for certain photographs and included black and white photographs as illustrations, accompanied by accents of light yellow-green and rosy red color.

6. Implementing my ideas using HTML, CSS, and Javascript gives me immense satisfaction, and I remain highly motivated, even though my work is not perfect. This marks my initial stride towards creating an interactive data visualization. I find numerous charts captivating, and I aspire to transform them into interactive formats. For me, the significance of incorporating interactivity into data lies in its ability to engage the audience. By allowing readers to explore the data on their own terms, I foster a deeper connection.

7. Despite my enthusiasm, one of the primary obstacles I face is my lack of prior knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Understanding the language of the d3 library proves challenging due to my limited understanding of Javascript. Additionally, being a non-native speaker, I frequently rely on Chinese tutorials to supplement my learning after class. However, I am making progress and currently possess the ability to create time series line and area charts. Nevertheless, I am uncertain about how to construct other chart types.

8. Also, I faced was executing the zoomable circle that aimed to depict demographic aspects such as sex, education, and occupation within the total population. As a beginner in utilizing d3, executing the zoomable circle proved to be overly complex for me. It necessitates prior knowledge in subgrouping data, a concept with which I was unfamiliar. Therefore, I had to remove the idea of the zoomable circle from my project. However, this did not discourage me from exploring other chart types. I continued to learn and explore new chart types to add to my project.

9. The most valuable insight I gained from my project pertains to comprehending and interpreting the d3 language. The template code provided by the course instructor offered clarity, while the instructions proved highly beneficial and straightforward. Moreover, the office hours with Professor Mia Szarvas greatly assisted me in overcoming challenges. Instead of providing direct answers, Mia guided me towards identifying the underlying issues, thereby enabling me to develop problem-solving skills for future endeavors.

10. The critiques I received during the project helped me to improve the final outcome significantly. The feedback I received challenged me to think critically about my work, and I made adjustments based on the feedback. For instance, I increased the interact level of my website due to the feedback I received. However, I donâ€™t have enough time to make a guideline when reader reading data. 

11. Given additional time and resources, one aspect I would enhance is the inclusion of a reader guideline. Taking "Window 1: Total Population of Hong Kongers in the United States" as an example, I believe it is crucial to provide informative notes pertaining to different age groups. By highlighting the declining trend among individuals aged 18-24 and the gradual increase among those aged 65 and above, it becomes possible to discern a societal pattern. Specifically, this trend suggests that younger generations are departing the United States, while a growing number of elderly individuals seek retirement within the country. These significant observations might go unnoticed by readers unless explicitly addressed in the analysis. Moreover, when examining the data by sex, readers can observe a similar population pattern between males and females, indicating a relatively equitable gender distribution to some extent. Moreover, I would endeavor to create additional types of interactive charts, such as the 100% stacked bar chart and pie chart. My personal aspiration is to replicate all infographics using JavaScript instead of relying on Adobe illustrator. Furthermore, I aim to allocate more time towards exploring raw data through data mining. For instance, I find the argument in regards to "Window 8: For ten years in a row, all Hong Kongers have identified themselves as Asian" to be unsatisfactory in some point. I believe there are more intriguing insights concealed within the data, yet limited time prevent me from thoroughly investigating them.
