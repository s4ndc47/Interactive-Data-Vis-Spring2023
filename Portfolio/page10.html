    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>"Throughout this project, I consistently grappled with the question of how to effectively depict an overview of a community. To accomplish this, I placed emphasis on key factors such as total population, sex distribution, age distribution, educational attainment, income levels, and occupational composition. I found that presenting these aspects in a time series format, viewed from the perspective of a data narrative, proved to be a favorable approach. Also, through the utilization of a line chart to compare the income levels between males and females, an evident gender income gap within the community is revealed.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, I sought to explore the impact of historical factors on the community. For instance, I aimed to investigate how the implementation of Obama's health insurance policy influenced the insurance rates among U.S. residents, particularly within the Hong Kong community. Additionally, I examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the employment status of Hong Kong individuals. Notably, there was a notable surge in remote work arrangements following 2019."</p>
