    <h3>Reflection 1/2</h3>
    <div class="Reflection">
      <p>My primary objective for this project is to create something related to Hong Kong, as I am deeply attached to my home country and possess a strong desire to contribute to its development. Initially, I wasn't particularly interested in the topic suggested by Professor, which involved utilizing the 2021 U.S. Census Data for an interactive project. Instead, I aimed to present data specific to Hong Kong. However, during my research, I stumbled upon a political campaign from 2020 titled "Fill Yourself as Hong Kongers" initiated by We the Hong Kongers. This led me to investigate the presence of "Hong Kong" within the U.S. Census data. Remarkably, I discovered that the U.S. census data has been including Hong Kong as an option for birthplace since 2011, spanning a period of ten years. This realization immediately sparked my interest, and I became determined to base my project on this topic.</p>
      <p>Initially, my project prospectus outlined the presentation of only two charts. However, as I delved deeper into the project, I found myself creating a total of ten charts. While the final outcomes significantly deviated from my initial prospectus, I am pleased with the progress I made.</p>
      <p>Throughout this project, I consistently grappled with the question of how to effectively depict an overview of a community. To accomplish this, I placed emphasis on key factors such as total population, sex distribution, age distribution, educational attainment, income levels, and occupational composition. I found that presenting these aspects in a time series format, viewed from the perspective of a data narrative, proved to be a favorable approach. Also, through the utilization of a line chart to compare the income levels between males and females, an evident gender income gap within the community is revealed.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I sought to explore the impact of historical factors on the community. For instance, I aimed to investigate how the implementation of Obama's health insurance policy influenced the insurance rates among U.S. residents, particularly within the Hong Kong community. Additionally, I examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the employment status of Hong Kong individuals. Notably, there was a notable surge in remote work arrangements following 2019.</p>
      <p>The major design decisions I made for my visuals include the font, color scheme, and the use of illustrations. For the font, I opted for the classic fonts Roboto for the body text and Merriweather for the headings primarily because of their accessibility and cost-effectiveness as free font options. For the color scheme, I aimed to create a modern, media-like aesthetic by choosing unusual colors. To enhance the visual impact, I incorporated illustrations into graphics. I also employed a black and white treatment for certain photographs and included black and white photographs as illustrations, accompanied by accents of light yellow-green and rosy red color.</p>
      <p>Implementing my ideas using HTML, CSS, and Javascript gives me immense satisfaction, and I remain highly motivated, even though my work is not perfect. This marks my initial stride towards creating an interactive data visualization. I find numerous charts captivating, and I aspire to transform them into interactive formats. For me, the significance of incorporating interactivity into data lies in its ability to engage the audience. By allowing readers to explore the data on their own terms, I foster a deeper connection.</p>
